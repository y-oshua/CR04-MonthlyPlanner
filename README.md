# MonthlyPlanner
Plan Stan - monthly planner with the ability to add priority levels and sort to-dos.

This project consists of a landing page and a reviews page. Plain HTML, CSS, and JS were used.

To view the pages simply clone this repo then open index.html / reviews.html into your browser.

This project was done as a solution to a end of the week project during my fullstack course at code factory.

Please view the assignment.pdf to view the expected results.

Cheers!
